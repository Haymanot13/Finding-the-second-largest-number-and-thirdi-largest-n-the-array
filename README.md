## Algorithm
   ### Initialize Variables:
1. Set first and second to a very small value (or the minimum possible integer).
   
   ### Iterate through the List:
2. For each number in the list: 
    1. If the number is greater than first: 
        1. Set second to first.
        2. Update first to the current number.
    2. Else if the number is greater than secondand not equal to first: 
        1. Update second to the current number.
   ### Return the Result:
3. If second is still the initial very small value, return an indication that the second largest number doesn't exist (e.g., -1).
4. Otherwise, return second.

   ### Algorithm to Find the Third Largest Element
Initialize Variables:
5. Set first, second, and third to a very small value (or the minimum possible integer).
Iterate through the List:
6. For each number in the list: 
    1. If the number is greater than first: 
        1. Set third to second.
        2. Set second to first.
        3. Update first to the current number.
    2. Else if the number is greater than secondand not equal to first: 
        1. Set third to second.
        2. Update second to the current number.
    3. Else if the number is greater than thirdand not equal to first or second: 
        1. Update third to the current number.
   ### Return the Result:
7. If third is still the initial very small value, return an indication that the third largest number doesn't exist (e.g., -1).
8. Otherwise, return third.
   ### Overall Algorithm for User Choice
 -Input the Number of Elements:
9. Prompt the user to enter the number of elements they want to input.
 -Input the Elements:
10. Create an empty list or array.
11. Loop through and allow the user to enter each number.
 -User Choice:
12. Prompt the user to enter 1 for the second largest number or 2 for the third largest number.
 -Call Appropriate Function:
13. Based on user choice, call the function to find the second or third largest number.
14. Print the result.
